# 🧠 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🚀 Task Overview

This repository contains my submission for **Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** as part of the **Data Analyst Internship** program. The objective of this task is to analyze the Titanic dataset using Python and derive meaningful insights using both statistical and visual exploration.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the classic [Titanic dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), which includes data about the passengers of the RMS Titanic and whether they survived or not.

**Files Used:**
- `train.csv` — primary dataset for EDA

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key EDA Steps Performed

- Dataset exploration using `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`
- Handling missing values and checking data types
- Univariate analysis (histograms, boxplots)
- Bivariate and multivariate analysis (scatterplots, pairplots, correlation heatmaps)
- Feature relationships and patterns
- Detection of outliers and skewness
- Summary of insights with visual explanation
